# Image Curation Concepts

This document covers the essential concepts for image data curation in NVIDIA NeMo Curator. These concepts assume basic familiarity with data science and machine learning principles.

## Core Concept Areas

Image curation in NVIDIA NeMo Curator focuses on these key areas:

::::{grid} 1 1 1 2
:gutter: 1 1 1 2

:::{grid-item-card} {octicon}`database;1.5em;sd-mr-1` Data Loading
:link: about-concepts-image-data-loading
:link-type: ref

Core concepts for loading and managing image datasets
:::

:::{grid-item-card} {octicon}`gear;1.5em;sd-mr-1` Data Processing
:link: about-concepts-image-data-processing
:link-type: ref

Concepts for embedding generation, classification, filtering, and deduplication
:::

:::{grid-item-card} {octicon}`device-camera;1.5em;sd-mr-1` Data Export
:link: about-concepts-image-data-export
:link-type: ref

Concepts for saving, exporting, and resharding curated image datasets

## Infrastructure Components

The image curation concepts build on NVIDIA NeMo Curator's core infrastructure components, which are shared across all modalities (text, image, video). These components include:
