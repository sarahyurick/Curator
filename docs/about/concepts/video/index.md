# Video Curation Concepts

This document covers the essential concepts for video data curation in NVIDIA NeMo Curator. These concepts assume basic familiarity with data science and machine learning principles.

## Core Concept Areas

Video curation in NVIDIA NeMo Curator focuses on these key areas:

## Notes on Modalities and Backends

Video pipelines in Curator run on Ray with the `XennaExecutor` integration for streaming and batch execution. Other modalities, such as text and image, also use RAPIDS and Curator’s distributed backends in parts of their workflows. Refer to the modality-specific guides for details.

## Infrastructure Components

The video curation concepts build on NVIDIA NeMo Curator's core infrastructure components. All modalities (text, image, video, and audio) use these components. These components include:
