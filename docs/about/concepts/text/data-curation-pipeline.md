## Pipeline Stages

NeMo Curator's text curation pipeline consists of several key stages that work together to transform raw data sources into high-quality datasets ready for LLM training:

### 1. Data Sources

Multiple input sources provide the foundation for text curation:

- **Cloud storage**: Amazon S3, Azure
- **Local workstation**: JSONL, Parquet

### 2. Data Acquisition & Processing

Raw data is downloaded, extracted, and converted into standardized formats:

- **Download & Extraction**: Retrieve and process remote data sources
- **Cleaning & Pre-processing**: Convert formats and normalize text
- **DocumentBatch Creation**: Standardize data into NeMo Curator's core data structure

### 3. Quality Assessment & Filtering

Multiple filtering stages ensure data quality:

- **Heuristic Quality Filtering**: Rule-based filters for basic quality checks
- **Model-based Quality Filtering**: Classification models trained to identify high vs. low quality text

### 4. Deduplication

Remove duplicate and near-duplicate content:

- **Exact Deduplication**: Remove identical documents using MD5 hashing
- **Fuzzy Deduplication**: Remove near-duplicates using MinHash and LSH similarity
- **Semantic Deduplication**: Remove semantically similar content using embeddings

### 5. Final Preparation

Prepare the curated dataset for training:

- **Format Standardization**: Ensure consistent output format

## Infrastructure Foundation

The entire pipeline runs on a robust, scalable infrastructure:

- **Ray**: Distributed computing framework for parallelization
- **RAPIDS**: GPU-accelerated data processing (cuDF, cuGraph, cuML)
- **Flexible Deployment**: CPU and GPU acceleration support

## Key Components

The pipeline leverages several core component types:

## Processing Modes

The pipeline supports different processing approaches:

**GPU Acceleration**: Leverage NVIDIA GPUs for:
- High-throughput data processing
- ML model inference for classification
- Embedding generation for semantic operations

**CPU Processing**: Scale across multiple CPU cores for:
- Text parsing and cleaning
- Rule-based filtering
- Large-scale data transformations

**Hybrid Workflows**: Combine CPU and GPU processing for optimal performance based on the specific operation.

## Scalability & Deployment

The architecture scales from single machines to large clusters:

- **Single Node**: Process datasets on laptops or workstations
- **Multi-Node**: Distribute processing across cluster resources
- **Cloud Native**: Deploy on cloud platforms
- **HPC Integration**: Run on HPC supercomputing clusters
