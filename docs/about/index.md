# Overview of NeMo Curator

NeMo Curator is an open-source, enterprise-grade platform for scalable, privacy-aware data curation across text, image, video, and audio modalities.

NeMo Curator, part of the NVIDIA NeMo software suite for managing the AI agent lifecycle, helps you prepare high-quality, compliant datasets for large language model (LLM) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) training. Whether you work in the cloud, on-premises, or in a hybrid environment, NeMo Curator supports your workflow.

## Target Users

- **Data scientists and machine learning engineers**: Build and curate datasets for LLMs, generative models, and multimodal AI.

- **Cluster administrators and DevOps professionals**: Deploy and scale curation pipelines.
- **Researchers**: Experiment with new data curation techniques and ablation studies.
- **Enterprises**: Ensure data privacy, compliance, and quality for production AI workflows.

## How It Works

NeMo Curator speeds up data curation by using modern hardware and distributed computing frameworks. You can process data efficiently—from a single laptop to a multi-node GPU cluster. With modular pipelines, advanced filtering, and easy integration with machine learning operations (MLOps) tools, leading organizations trust NeMo Curator.

- **Text Curation**: Uses a pipeline-based architecture with modular processing stages running on Ray. Data flows through data download, extraction, language detection, rule-based quality filtering, deduplication (exact, fuzzy and semantic) and model based quality filtering.
- **Image Curation**: Uses pipeline-based architecture with modular stages for loading, embedding generation, classification (aesthetic, NSFW), filtering, and export workflows. Supports distributed processing with optional GPU acceleration.
- **Video Curation**: Employs Ray-based pipelines to split long videos into clips using fixed stride or scene-change detection, with optional encoding, filtering, embedding generation, and deduplication for large-scale video processing.
- **Audio Curation**: Provides ASR inference using models, quality assessment through Word Error Rate (WER) calculation, duration analysis, and integration with text curation workflows for speech data processing.

### Key Technologies

- **Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)**: Speed up data processing for large-scale workloads.
- **Distributed Computing**: Supports frameworks like Dask, RAPIDS, and Ray for scalable, parallel processing.
- **Modular Pipelines**: Build, customize, and scale curation workflows to fit your needs.
- **MLOps Integration**: Seamlessly connects with modern MLOps environments for production-ready workflows.
