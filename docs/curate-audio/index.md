# About Audio Curation

NeMo Curator provides comprehensive audio curation capabilities to prepare high-quality speech data for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and multi-modal model training. The toolkit includes processors for loading audio datasets, performing ASR inference, assessing transcription quality, and integrating with text curation workflows.

## Use Cases

- Process and curate large-scale speech datasets for ASR model training
- Perform quality assessment and filtering based on transcription accuracy metrics
- Generate transcriptions using state-of-the-art NVIDIA NeMo ASR models
- Integrate audio processing with text curation pipelines for multi-modal workflows
- Scale audio processing across GPU clusters efficiently
