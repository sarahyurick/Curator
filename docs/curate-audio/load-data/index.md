# Load Audio Data

Import audio datasets from various sources into NeMo Curator's audio processing pipeline. Audio data loading supports manifest files, direct file paths, and automated dataset downloads.

## How it Works

Audio data loading in NeMo Curator centers around the `AudioBatch` data structure, which contains:

- **Audio file paths**: References to audio files (.wav, .mp3, .flac, etc.)
- **Transcriptions**: Ground truth or reference text for speech content
- **Metadata**: Duration, language, speaker information, and quality metrics

The loading process validates audio file existence and formats data for downstream ASR inference and quality assessment stages.

## Loading Methods

Choose the appropriate loading method based on your data source and format:
