# WER Filtering

Filter audio samples based on Word Error Rate (WER) thresholds to ensure high-quality transcription accuracy in your speech datasets. WER filtering is the primary quality control mechanism for ASR-based audio curation.

## Understanding WER

### What is Word Error Rate?

Word Error Rate measures transcription accuracy by calculating the percentage of words that differ between ground truth and ASR predictions:

```text
WER = (Substitutions + Deletions + Insertions) / Total_Reference_Words × 100
```

### WER Quality Levels

| WER Range | Quality Level | Recommended Use |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| 0-10% | Excellent | Production ASR training, high-quality datasets |
| 10-25% | Good | General ASR training, most applications |
| 25-50% | Moderate | Supplementary training data, domain adaptation |
| 50-75% | Poor | Review required, potential filtering |
| 75%+ | Very Poor | Strong candidate for removal |

## Basic WER Filtering

### Calculate WER

```python
from nemo_curator.stages.audio.metrics.get_wer import GetPairwiseWerStage

# Calculate WER for audio samples
wer_stage = GetPairwiseWerStage(
    text_key="text",           # Ground truth transcription
    pred_text_key="pred_text", # ASR model prediction
    wer_key="wer"             # Output field for WER value
)

# Add to pipeline
pipeline.add_stage(wer_stage)
```

### Apply WER Threshold

```python
from nemo_curator.stages.audio.common import PreserveByValueStage

# Keep samples with WER ≤ 30% (good quality)
wer_filter = PreserveByValueStage(
    input_value_key="wer",
    target_value=30.0,
    operator="le"  # less than or equal
)

pipeline.add_stage(wer_filter)
```

## Advanced WER Filtering


### Statistical WER Filtering

For statistical analysis-based threshold selection, you can analyze your dataset's WER distribution and then apply the calculated threshold using NeMo Curator's `PreserveByValueStage`:

```python
# Apply calculated statistical threshold
statistical_filter = PreserveByValueStage(
    input_value_key="wer",
    target_value=calculated_threshold,  # From your statistical analysis
    operator="le"
)
```

## Domain-Specific WER Filtering

### Conversational Speech

```python
# More lenient thresholds for conversational speech
conversational_wer_config = {
    "excellent_threshold": 15.0,  # vs. 10.0 for read speech
    "good_threshold": 35.0,       # vs. 25.0 for read speech  
    "acceptable_threshold": 60.0   # vs. 50.0 for read speech
}

conversational_filter = PreserveByValueStage(
    input_value_key="wer",
    target_value=conversational_wer_config["good_threshold"],
    operator="le"
)
```

### Broadcast and News

```python
# Stricter thresholds for high-quality broadcast speech
broadcast_wer_config = {
    "excellent_threshold": 5.0,   # Very strict
    "good_threshold": 15.0,       # Stricter than general
    "acceptable_threshold": 25.0   # Maximum for broadcast quality
}

broadcast_filter = PreserveByValueStage(
    input_value_key="wer", 
    target_value=broadcast_wer_config["good_threshold"],
    operator="le"
)
```
