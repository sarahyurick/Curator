# Video Pipeline Customization Tutorials

Use the tutorials in this section to learn how to customize video pipelines using NeMo Curator.

You can customize the **environments**, **code**, **models**, and **stages** used in NeMo Curator pipelines.

## Before You Start

Before you begin customizing NeMo Curator pipelines, make sure that you have:

- Reviewed the [pipeline concepts and diagrams](about-concepts-video).  
- A working NeMo Curator development environment.  
- Reviewed the [container environments](reference-infrastructure-container-environments) reference.
