# About Getting Started

## Before You Start

Welcome to NeMo Curator! This framework streamlines the curation and pre-processing of large-scale datasets for training generative AI models across text, image, audio and video modalities.

**Who are these quickstarts for?**
- AI/ML engineers and researchers who want to quickly test NeMo Curator's capabilities
- Users looking to run an initial curation pipeline with minimal setup
- Individuals exploring NeMo Curator prior to a full production deployment

**What you'll find here:**
Each quickstart enables you to get started with a specific domain in less than 30 minutes. Quickstarts provide basic installation steps, sample data, and a working example.

:::{tip}
For production deployments, cluster configurations, or detailed system requirements, refer to the [Setup & Deployment documentation](admin-overview).
